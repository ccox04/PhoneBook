We are writing a program that will take in records and sort them back for the user.  It will have a user \
input which contact they desire, sort through the list. Then output the intended contact.

We plan on using the unix philosphy of modularity.  This will be a key point in our project because we wo\
uld like to build something that is reuseable.

At the moment we are using regex to run the search for a contact. In order to use these you have to run this comman in\
 Ubuntu:sudo apt-get install libboost-regex-dev or fedora:sudo yum install boost-devel
