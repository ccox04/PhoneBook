We are writing a program that will take in records and sort them back for the user.  It will have a user \
input which contact they desire, sort through the list. Then output the intended contact.

We plan on using the unix philosphy of modularity.  This will be a key point in our project because we wo\
uld like to build something that is reuseable.
